# SudokuSolver

Simple sudoku solver.

It loads sudoku from CSV file and tries to solve it using elimination. If it fails, it guesses one number and tries again. It is usually enough to solve even hard sudokus.

It doesn't use bruteforce, so it will fail sometimes on really hard sudokus.

Example sudokus: sudoku_hard272.csv and sudoku_hard274.csv
